= GW2map

https://tufteddeer.github.io/gw2map/[Visit the map]

A small project I did for my web technology course.
It fetches data from the official https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:1/map_floor[GW2 API] and displays it on a map using https://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet].

NOTE: This project is not optimized for performance, so you may experience some lags or stuttering.
You can improve your experience by unselecting some marker categories below the map.

== Stuff I used

- https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:1/map_floor[The official GW2 API] for the data
- https://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet] for rendering the map
- http://classless.de/[classless.css] for the eyecandy
- https://www.browsersync.io/[Browsersync] as development server
